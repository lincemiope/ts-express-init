### What is this repository for? ###

* This is a template for the creation and initialisation of ExpressJS projects that use TypeScript. It includes several packages for general purpose such as ts-md5, geolib etc. View engine is Handlebars. It's a well documented engine and has many similarities with Jinja2 (Python). Base database driver is pg-promise which interacts only with PostgreSQL, but it can be replaced since it's just a template.
* Version 1.0

### How do I get set up? ###
